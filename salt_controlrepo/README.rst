``sun-java``
------------

Downloads the tarball from the java:source_url configured as either a pillar or grain and will not do anything
if source_url is omitted. Then unpacks the archive into java:prefix (defaults to /usr/share/java).
Will use the alternatives system to link the installation to java_home. Please see the pillar.example for configuration.

``sun-java.jce``
----------------

Downloads and installs the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files. Will include/extend the sun-java state.

``sun-java.env``
----------------

An addition to allow easy use - places a java profile in /etc/profile.d - this way JAVA_HOME and the PATH are set correctly for all system users.

Tested on RedHat/CentOS 5.X or RedHat/CentOS 6.X, AmazonOS and Ubuntu.
